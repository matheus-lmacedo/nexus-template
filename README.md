## 📂 Getting Started / How to Use

1.  After downloading, unzip the file.
2.  The file structure is as follows:

    ```
    /
    ├── index.html
    └── src/
        ├── css/
        │   ├── styles.css
        │   └── responsive.css
        ├── images/
        │   ├── bg-main.jpg
        │   └── mockup.jpg

    ```

3.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the template locally.
4.  Edit the content (text and images) directly in `index.html`.
5.  To change the styles, modify the files in `src/css/`.

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors

The main colors can be easily changed at the beginning of the `src/css/styles.css` file. I recommend using CSS variables for easier control.

### Fonts

The template uses the **Orbitron** and **Chalet Comprime** fonts. You can change them by editing the link in the `<head>` of `index.html` and on `src/fonts/` folder.

### Images

- **Main Background Image:** Replace the `bg-main.jpg` file in the `src/images/` folder.
- **"Buy Now" Section Background:** Replace the `bg-section.jpg` file in the `src/images/` folder.
- **Product Image:** Replace the `mockup.jpg` file in the `src/images/` folder.

### Logo

The logo in the header is an inline SVG. To replace it, copy your own SVG code and paste it in place of the existing SVG inside the `<div class="logo">` in `index.html`.
